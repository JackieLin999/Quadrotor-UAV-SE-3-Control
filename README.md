# Geometric Tracking Control of a Quadrotor UAV on SE(3)

# Description
This project implements the geometric tracking control strategies for a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as presented in the paper "[Geometric Tracking Control of a Quadrotor UAV on SE(3)](https://math.ucsd.edu/~mleok/pdf/LeLeMc2010_quadrotor.pdf)" by Taeyoung Lee, Melvin Leok, and N. Harris McClamroch. The goal is to achieve robust and precise trajectory tracking on the Special Euclidean group SE(3), enabling aggressive maneuvers and enhanced stability.
